Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML via a render() function.

- Reusable
- Individual piece of User Interface
- Custom Html Element [React Component]

Components come in two types,

1. Class components
2. Function components

**Rules:**

- Uppercase First Letter is Important is React Components
- Differentiate Between Html and Components
- Must define Render function

```js title="Component Example"
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

class Header extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <p> This is from Header</p>;
  }
}
const jsx = (
  <div>
    <Header />
  </div>
);

ReactDOM.render(jsx, document.getElementById('root'));
```

## Class Component

When creating a React component, the component's name must start with an upper case letter.

The component has to include the extends React.Component statement, this statement creates an inheritance to React.Component, and gives your component access to React.Component's functions.

The component also requires a render() method, this method returns HTML.

```js
class Car extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
  }
}
```

Display the Car component in the "root" element:

```js
ReactDOM.render(<Car />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

## Functional Component

Here is the same example as above, but created using a Function component instead.

A Function component also returns HTML, and behaves pretty much the same way as a Class component, but Class components have some additions, and will be preferred in this tutorial.

```js
function Car() {
  return <h2>Hi, I am also a Car!</h2>;
}
```

Display the Car component in the "root" element:

```js
ReactDOM.render(<Car />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

## Component Constructor

If there is a constructor() function in your component, this function will be called when the component gets initiated. The constructor function is where you initiate the component's properties. In React, component properties should be kept in an object called state.

```js
class Car extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = {color: 'red'};
  }
  render() {
    return <h2>I am a Car!</h2>;
  }
}
```

## Nesting Components

We can refer to components inside other components:

```js
class Car extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h2>I am a Car!</h2>;
  }
}

class Garage extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Who lives in my Garage?</h1>
        <Car />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<Garage />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

## Components in Files

React is all about re-using code, and it can be smart to insert some of your components in separate files.

To do that, create a new file with a .js file extension and put the code inside it:

Note that the file must start by importing React (as before), and it has to end with the statement export default Car;

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

class Car extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
  }
}

export default Car;
```

## Component Props

Another way of handling component properties is by using props. Props are like function arguments, and you send them into the component as attributes.

React Props are like function arguments in JavaScript and attributes in HTML.

```js
class Car extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h2>I am a {this.props.color} Car!</h2>;
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<Car color="red" />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

## Default Props Values

Allow to past data through props and create default Props

```javascript
const Header = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{props.title}</h1>
      {props.subtitle && <h2>{props.subtitle}</h2>}
    </div>
  );
};

Header.defaultProps = {
  title: 'Indecision',
};
```
