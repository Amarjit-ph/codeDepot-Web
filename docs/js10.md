[ES5 + Cheatsheet](https://devhints.io/es6) - A quick overview of new JavaScript features in ES2015, ES2016, ES2017, ES2018 and beyond.

## Let & const

Javascript is most famous implementation of ECMA Script <br/> ECAM decide what should included in the new version

ES5 Old Javascript

- Supported in basically all browser,including old IE
- Only had var, not let or const
- Generally same syntax as ES6, but quite some missing features

ES6 Mordern Javascript

- Supported in modern browsers, can (mostly) be transpiled to ES5
- Many new features that help us write cleaner, better & faster code
- Still under active development, but ES6 was a big step forward

1. `var`

- Creates a variable
- Available since begining
- Function & Global scope

1. Block scope only inside function
2. Global Scope
3. No block scope in `{}`

` No use case for var keyword only for browser support it still exist`

2. `let`

- Creates a variable
- Available since ES6
- Block scope inside `{}`

3. `const`

- Creates a constant
- Available since ES6
- Block scope inside `{}`

## Hoisting

Hoisting is a javaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.

```js
// REAL CODE
console.log(userName); // Undefined
var userName = 'MAX';

// HOISTING
var userName;
console.log(userName);
userName = 'MAX';

// let - Cannot Access before Initialization
```

## Strict Mode

Strict mode is declared by adding "use strict"; to the beginning of a script or a function.

Declared at the beginning of a script, it has global scope (all code in the script will execute in strict mode):

```js
x = 3.14; // Works
```

```js
'use strict';
x = 3.14; // Error
```

## Code Parse & Compile

Code > Browser> > Computer <br/> Code > Parsing & Execution [Browser]

1. Interpreter - Starts Execution > Byte Code
2. Compiler > Complied machine code
3. Computer Execution

Browser APIs > Login built into browser Chrome Compliler > Turbo fan

## Code Execution

Inside the JavaScript Engine “The thing that executes your code” JavaScript is single-threaded: “One thing happens at a time”

1. Memory allocation - `Heap` Stores data in your system memory and manages access to it

2. Execution context - `Stack` Manages your program flow (function calls and communication)<br/> Whenever function execute and return value it is removed/pop from the stack

**Primitive Values**

- Strings, Numbers, Booleans, null, undefined, Symbol
- Stored in memory (normally on Stack), variable stores value itself
- Copying a variable (= assign to different variable) copies the value

**Reference Values**

- All other objects (“more expensive to create”)
- Stored in memory (Heap), variable stores a pointer (address) to location in memory
- Copying a variable (= assign to different variable) copies the pointer/ reference

**Garbage Collector (V8’s)**

- Beware of “Memory Leaks”: Unused objects where you still hold references to
- Periodically checks Heap for unused objects (objects without references)
- Removes unused objects

## Dark side of Javascript

1. Objects and arrays are kind of special in JavaScript!

`{ name: ‘Max’ } === or == { name: ‘Max’ }` > false<br/> `["Hello"] === or == { "Hello" }` > false

2. Hoisting

Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.

## Efficient Development & Debugging

Get Unstuck & Stay Productive

**1. Write Code Efficiently**

- Use Keyboard Shortcut
- Parameter Hints
- vscode/settings.json
- Auto-formate code & use shortcuts

**2. Find Help**

- Use MDN
- Professional Google
- Ask proper question
- Trail & Error

**3. Debug your code**

- Read and uitize error message
- Use console.log()
- Use breakpoints - Chrome dev sources
- Debugger for chrome

**GOOGLE CORRECTLY - KEYWORDS**
